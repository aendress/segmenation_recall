# Recall experiment for word segmentation

* Experiments: experimental file.
	- Psyscope files are not uploaded since they cannot be run any longer anyhow.
	- The online version of the recall experiment is available at
* Results: data and analysis scripts
	- The main file is `segmentation_recall_combined.Rmd`
	- An updated version working with R 4.1.1 is `segmentation_recall_combined_for_R_version_4.1.1.Rmd`
	- A version working with R 4.1.1 and containing updated figures/tables is Â§segmentation_recall_combined_for_revision.Rmd`. This file contains the following changes:
		+ Tables report GLMM results now include odds ratios
		+ Some multiple panel figures have been separated into separated figures
		+ There is a single figure for all conditions in Experiment 2 (i.e., the non-recall conditions)
		+ Analyses after removing outliers.
